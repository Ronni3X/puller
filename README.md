# puller
The puller application will interact with an open Internet Explorer window to click through an email list and write the emails on each page to a file. The code only works on a specific website. Improvements still need to be made.

To use, verify the output file in the puller.vbs file is correct then run the following in a command prompt:

cscript.exe puller.vbs
